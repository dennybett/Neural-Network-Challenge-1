# AI Bootcamp Module 18 Challenge

## Neural Networks Challenge 1

### Loan Repayment Prediction Model

#### Project description

In this challenge, I took the imaginary position of a machine learning engineer in a company that specializes in student loans refinancing. I was tasked with creating a model that will provide an accurate interest rate for the borrower.

To accomplish this, I was given information about previous student loan recepients. I used machine learning and neuro networks to create a model that predicted the likelihood that an applicant will repay their loans.
